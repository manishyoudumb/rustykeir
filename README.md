## 🎭 The Programming Language That Roasts You Back

Keir Lang is not your average programming language. It's here to challenge your code and your ego simultaneously. Are you ready for a language that's as sassy as it is functional?

### 🔥 Features

- **Brutally Honest Error Messages**: Why settle for boring errors when you can be insulted by your compiler?
- **Mathematically Sound**: Performs calculations with the precision of a caffeinated mathematician.
- **Unary Operators**: Because sometimes, one is all you need.
- **Parentheses Support**: For when you need to group your thoughts (and your expressions).
- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizes your input faster than you can type "syntax error".
- **Recursive Descent Parsing**: Parses expressions with the grace of a ballet dancer... on a minefield.
- **Floating-Point Arithmetic**: Because integers are too mainstream.

### 🛠️ Quick Start

1. Clone the repo
2. Install Rust (I assume you're smart enough to do it)
3. Run `cargo init` in the project directory
4. Run `cargo build --release`
5. Prepare for emotional damage

### 🧪 Test Cases

- Keir Lang comes with a robust suite of tests to ensure it roasts your code correctly.
- Run `cargo test --release`
- If you're feeling adventurous, try running `cargo test --release -- --nocapture` too.
